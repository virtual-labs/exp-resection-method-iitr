Step-1) Click on the main file and wait until home screen appears.<br><br>
Step-2) By clicking on <b>BACKGROUND INFORMATION Button</b> following window will appear.<br><br>
Step-3) By clicking on <b>PLANE TABLE ACCESSORIES Button</b> following window will appear.<br><br>
Step-4) By clicking on <b>OBSERVATION & PLOTTING Button</b> following window will appear & we get a 2 D and realistic environment which is user friendly:<br><br>
Step-5) There are 3 objects(tree, street light and big electric pole) pointed by arrows and a Plane Table located inside all of the 3 objects. Three points are already plotted on the Plane Table using either Radiation methd or Intersection method. On the
lower left corner, there is also a panel for alidade view of object.<br><br>
Step-6) On the left side of the pane, alidade view of objects is also given to see the clear view of the objects.<br>
Step-7) Click on a object to get alidade view of object and a line is drawn.<br><br>
Step-8) Accordingly, clicking on other 2 objects, we get a triangle of error.<br><br>

Step-9) Now click on “C” labeled on tripod to get center point of triangle.<br><br>
Step-10)Then click on tree object to draw a line (colored blue) joining center point and already plotted point on Plane Table.<br><br>
Step-11) Now, click on the red curved arrow to rotate the Plane Table. Then,click on the other two objects.<br><br>
Step-12) Ultimately, you will get a single point on plane table rather than a triangle of error. This will be the location of station occupied by the Plane Table.<br><br>
Step-13) After taking all the observations click on <b>Result Button </b>.<br><br>
Step-14) Observations are displayed in the graphical form i.e. in triangular form.<br><br>
